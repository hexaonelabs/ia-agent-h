# Agent H ü§ñ 

> Autonomous Agent Framework for NodeJS

Agent-H, the little sister of [EizaOS](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza), is a lightweight and modular framework that enables the management of multiple AI assistants. While inspired by the EizaOS project, This framework is designed to be more modular, extensible, and easier to use and scale. As a younger sibling in the AI agent family, Agent-H builds upon the foundation laid by ElizaOS, offering a fresh approach to autonomous agent frameworks with a focus on simplicity and blockchain integration.

## Project Description
Agent-H represents a sophisticated autonomous agent framework designed for NodeJS, offering an innovative approach to AI assistant management with seamless blockchain integration. Emerging as the younger sibling of ElizaOS, this framework distinguishes itself through its modular architecture and advanced capabilities. The core of Agent-H is built around a robust service that leverages OpenAI's powerful language models to create intelligent and responsive assistants.

At its heart, the framework enables dynamic creation and management of multiple AI agents, each capable of executing complex tasks through sophisticated tool handling and inter-agent communication. The system supports creating threads, sending messages, and managing conversations with remarkable flexibility. What sets Agent-H apart is its intelligent agent delegation mechanism, where different assistants can collaborate and execute tools across the ecosystem, creating a more interconnected and powerful AI environment.

The framework's design emphasizes extensibility and ease of use, allowing developers to quickly configure new assistants by defining their specific instructions, tools, and behaviors through simple configuration files. Its advanced run management system ensures robust error handling, tool execution, and seamless interaction between agents. By integrating logging, dynamic tool management, and a flexible architecture, Agent-H provides developers with a powerful toolkit for building sophisticated, context-aware AI applications that can adapt and scale according to project requirements.

Unleash the power of intelligent, autonomous agents in the decentralized world with Agent H!

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 20+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [OpenIA API Key](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/general)

### Start by clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hexaonelabs/ia-agent-h
cd ia-agent-h
cp .env.example .env
```

Once the agent is running, open you browser to `localhost:3000` and you should see the Agent H interface.

### Environment Variables
1. open `.env` file and add your OpenAI API Key, Twitter credentials and other configuration that you want to use.
2. Provide the seed phrase or privateKey of the wallet that you want to use to interact with the blockchain. This wallet will be used to sign transactions and interact with the blockchain.

### Edit Agent character files configuration
1. open `characters/agent-h.yml` file and edit the character name, description and other details. This file provide configurations for the main orchestrator agent. Do not remove this file.
2. add, edit or remove assistant with character file. Each character file will be loaded to generate an assistant based on the configuration provided in the file.

### Agent Controller
Some agent are designed to execute a specific task or to handle a specific type of request. To define an agent with controller, just provide `Ctrl: agents/{AGENT_CTRL}.agent` to the file configuration yml. You can create your own agent controller by creating a new file inside `src/agents` directory and export a Object with a `start()` function that will be called to run dedicated logic.

### Edit tool files configuration
Add, edit or remove tools with file inside `tools/{TOOL_FILE}.yml` directory. Each tool file will be loaded to generate a tool based on the configuration provided in the file. The tool have an `Handler` property that should be the name of the file inside `src/tools` directory that will be used to handle the tool logic. 

You can create your own tools by creating a new file inside `src/tools` directory and export a function that will be called when the tool is used. The function should return data that will be send to the main agent to generate a response to the user.

### Start development server
```bash
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

### Start production server
```bash
npm install
npm run start:prod
```

or you can use `pm2` to run the server in background

```bash
npm install -g pm2
npm install
npm run start:pm2
```

*Note: The server will be running on `localhost:3000` by default. You can change the port by editing the `.env` file. You have multiples auther build in srcipts that you can use to manage the server, lint the code, run test and more. Check the `package.json` file for more information.*
